## What is cloud computing?
- Delivery of computing services across the internet, including servers, storage, database, networking services, etc.
- pay as you use helping lower your operating cost, run infrastructure more efficiently & scale your as business needs change

## Top benefits of cloud computing
1. Cost
- helps optimize IT costs.
- eliminates capital expenses of buying hardware & software & setting up, and running onsite data centers,experts for managing the infrastructure. 
2. Speed
- most cloud computing services are provided self-service & on demand to even vast amounts of resources can be provisioned in minutes.
3. Global scale
- it scales elastically, in cloud it means delivering right amount of IT resources when they are needed (ex- bandwidth, storage, more or less computing power).
4. Productivity
- removes onsite datacenters requirements like hardware setup,software patching & other IT management chores,so IT teams can spend time on morre important goals. 
5. Performance
- reduce network latency for application & greater economic of scale
6. Reliability
- Cloud computing makes data backup, disaster recovery & business continuity easier and less expensive because data can be mirrored at multiple redundant sites on cloud provider's network.
7. Security
- Cloud offers a broad set of policies, technologies & controls to strengthen security posture.

## Types of cloud computing
### 1. Public cloud
- They are owned by a third-party cloud server provider that delivers internet computing services.
- Here all hardware, software & other supporting infrastructure is owned and managed by the cloud provider.
- Users can access these services & manage accounts using a web browser.
- ex: Azure
### 2. Private cloud
- refers to cloud computing resources used exclusively by a single business or organization.
- Private cloud can be located on company's onsite data center or they can pay third-party service providers to host their private cloud.
- here services & infrastructure are maintained on a private network.
### 3. Hybrid cloud
- Combination of private & public clouds bound together by technology that allows data & applications to be shared between them.
- By allowing data & applications to move between private & public clouds, hybrid cloud gives businesses greater flexibility and more deployment options.
- Helps optimize existing infrastructure, security and compliance.

## Types of Cloud Services
- Also called cloud computing stack because they are build on top of one another.
### 1. Iaas
- most basic category of cloud computing.
- you rent IT infrastructure from a cloud provider on pay-as-you-go basis.
### 2. PaaS
- refers to cloud computing service that supply on on-demand env for developing, testing, delivering & managing software.
- pass is designed to make it easier for developers to quickly create web or mobile apps without worrying about the underlying infrastructure of server storage, network & db needed for development.
### 3. SaaS
- Method of delivering software applications over internet on demand & typically on subscription basis.
- cloud provider host & manage underlying infrastructure, handle any maintenance like software upgrades & patching.
- Users connect to applications over internet, usually web browsers on their PC,table or phone.
### 4. Serverless Computing
- overlapping with PaaS, it focuses on building app functionality without spending time continuously managing the servers & infrastructure required to do so.
- cloud provider handles setup, capacity planning, and server management for you.
- highly scalable & event-driven, only using resources when a specific function or trigger occurs.
